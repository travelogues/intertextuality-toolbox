          This visualization displays the result of our preliminary analysis of 'intertextuality'
          in a <a href="https://github.com/travelogues/travelogues-corpus/tree/master/16th_century" target="_blank">corpus 
          of 16th Century German-language travelogues</a>. The x-axis shows the range from 1500 to 1600, with 
          dots for works that were published in this year. (Largeer dots mean that more works in the corpus 
          were published in this year.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Arcs <strong>above</strong> the x-axis indicate when there is text reuse between works, i.e. works from the 
          corresponding year contain <strong>similar text passages</strong> (measured using character n-gram profiles). Arcs 
          <strong>below</strong> the x-axis indicate that works reference the <strong>same places</strong> (identified through 
          Named Entity Recognition). Use the sliders to filter the arcs by the threshold values, i.e. the minimum and maximum
          percentage of overlap between works.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The x-axis is color-coded. Dots that have connections (for the given slider settings) are shown in blue. You will 
          notice that some dots are blue, despite no arcs extending from them. In this case, there are connections between 
          works of the same (or an adjacent) year.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Hover your mouse over a dot to show <strong>just</strong> the connections extending to and from it. Click the dot 
          to get extra information about the specific works at the dot and their connections.
